## Sources Used

This was my very first attempt at ricing and thus, I needed help from a variety of sources. These are the sources that I borrowed heavily from. I based off my work from channel-42's dotfiles and gradualy as I got more comfortable, I started adding my own tweaks. While most the time reading the documentation or the man page or the Arch Wiki helped me, there were still times where I needed some inspiration as well as sources for ricing. Apart from the documentation of the vaious packagaes, these are the sources that helped me a lot.
